# Rock Classification AI – Streamlit Application

This repository contains a Rock Type Classification application built with PyTorch (ResNet-34) and Streamlit.
It allows you to upload or capture images of rocks, and outputs predicted rock classes with confidence scores.

🛠️ How to Run This App Locally

These steps assume you downloaded the project from Google Drive to your local machine.

1️⃣ Download the Project

Open the Drive link above.

Select all files and folders.

Click Download and extract them to a local directory, e.g.,

D:\rock-classification-streamlit


⚠️ Avoid working directly from the Drive sync folder to avoid path issues.

2️⃣ Install Python

Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed.
Check with:

python --version

3️⃣ Open in Visual Studio Code

Launch Visual Studio Code

Go to File → Open Folder

Choose the project directory you extracted above.

4️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

In VS Code terminal:

Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

macOS / Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate


If successful, the terminal shows:

(venv)

5️⃣ Install Dependencies

Run:

pip install -r requirements.txt


If requirements.txt isn’t present or incomplete:

pip install streamlit torch torchvision pillow matplotlib tqdm

6️⃣ Run the App

From the project root:

streamlit run app.py


Streamlit will show:

Local URL: http://localhost:8501


Open this link in your browser.

🚀 Using the App

Upload a rock image

Or activate Camera Mode

Adjust:

Top-K predictions

Confidence threshold

View predictions and interpreted confidence labels:

🟢 Defined (high confidence)

🟡 Possible (ambiguous)

Always validate with field and petrographic analysis.

🧠 Notes

This is a research-support tool and should not replace expert geological interpretation.

🧩 Common Fixes
Issue	Solution
streamlit not found	pip install streamlit
No checkpoint found	Ensure folder Checkpoints_Rocks_FINAL contains checkpoint_125.pth
Torch errors	pip install torch torchvision
