# Rock Type Classification Using Deep Learning  ResNet-34 Architecture–Based Approach

This project presents an image-based rock type classification system using a deep learning approach built on the **ResNet-34 architecture**.  
The model is designed to automatically identify lithological classes from rock images to support geological and geophysical data analysis and interpretation.

⚠️ **Project Status:** Under active development  
Model behavior, class labels, and predictions may evolve as the dataset and training strategy are further refined.

## Project Overview

Rock identification traditionally relies on expert geological interpretation through field observation and laboratory analysis.  
This project explores the application of **computer vision and deep learning** to assist preliminary lithological classification using macroscopic rock images captured in the field or uploaded from files.

The system is intended as a **decision-support tool**, not a replacement for professional geological judgment.

The project consists of:

- A **PyTorch-based training pipeline**
- A **ResNet-34 inference model**
- A **Streamlit-based field identification application** with image upload and camera support

---

## Model Architecture

- **Backbone:** ResNet-34  
- **Framework:** PyTorch  
- **Pretrained weights:** ImageNet  
- **Training strategy:**
  - Transfer learning
  - Custom classification head
  - Partial fine-tuning (final residual block)
  - Checkpoint-based training and inference

The model is trained to classify **53 rock types**, covering igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic lithologies.

## Rock Classes

The dataset includes 53 lithological classes such as:

Amphibolite, Andesite, Basalt, Granite, Gneiss, Limestone, Marble, Sandstone, Shale, Slate, Tuff, Travertine, Quartzite, Rhyolite, and others.
